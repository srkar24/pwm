**Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Projects on Zybo Board**

This project implements various Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) functionalities on the Zybo board using VHDL. The project includes LED dimming, servo control, and creating a rainbow effect with RGB LEDs based on switch positions. A demo video has been pushed to showcase the project.

Hardware used: 
Zybo Z7-10/20,
SG90 9G Micro Servo (https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/dfrobot/SER0006/7597224)

Software used: Xilinx Vivado
